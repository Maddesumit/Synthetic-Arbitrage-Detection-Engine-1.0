- **Calculation Pipeline**: Thread-safe calculation pipeline for concurrent operations

### âœ… Black-Scholes Options Pricing
- **Option Pricing**: Complete Black-Scholes implementation for calls and puts
- **Greeks Calculation**: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho calculations
- **Implied Volatility**: Basic implied volatility estimation
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimized for high-frequency pricing updates

### âœ… Synthetic Pricing Models
- **Perpetual Swaps**: Spot + Funding rate pricing model
- **Futures Pricing**: Spot + Cost of carry with time decay
- **Basis Calculation**: Futures basis and annualized basis calculations
- **Multi-instrument Support**: Unified pricing interface for all instrument types

### âœ… Performance Optimization
- **SIMD Optimization**: Vectorized mathematical operations using xsimd
- **Memory Pools**: Custom memory management for PricingResult objects
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent pricing calculations with mutex protection
- **Cache-friendly Structures**: Optimized data layouts for performance

### âœ… Arbitrage Detection Framework
- **ArbitrageDetector**: Complete framework for opportunity detection
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable thresholds and risk limits
- **Opportunity Validation**: Profit, risk, and confidence validation
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive performance metrics

## Technical Achievements

### Build System
- âœ… CMake configuration updated for all Phase 3 components
- âœ… External dependencies properly integrated (xsimd, spdlog, nlohmann/json)
- âœ… Header-only template implementation for MemoryPool
- âœ… Clean compilation on macOS/Clang with C++20

### Demo Application
- âœ… Comprehensive Phase 3 demo (`phase3_demo.cpp`)
- âœ… Real-time pricing calculations demonstration
- âœ… SIMD operations showcase
- âœ… Multi-instrument pricing validation
- âœ… Performance metrics display

### Code Quality
- âœ… Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and logging
- âœ… Thread-safe concurrent operations
- âœ… Extensive configuration support via JSON

## Performance Results
```
Black-Scholes Pricing: âœ… Real-time calculations
SIMD Operations: âœ… Vectorized mathematical operations  
Pricing Engine: âœ… Multi-instrument support (3 instrument types)
Arbitrage Detection: âœ… Framework ready for opportunity detection
Memory Management: âœ… High-performance memory pools
```

## Key Technical Fixes
1. **MemoryPool Template Issue**: Moved implementation from .cpp to .hpp for proper template instantiation
2. **SIMD Compatibility**: Refactored xsimd usage for macOS/Clang/ARM compatibility
3. **CMake Integration**: Proper PUBLIC header propagation for xsimd dependency
4. **ArbitrageDetector**: Constructor initialization for parameter defaults

## Next Steps
- âœ… **Phase 3 Complete**: All deliverables achieved
- ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 9 (UI/UX)**: Implement real-time dashboard for visualization
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 4**: Mispricing Detection Engine (after UI implementation)

## Files Created/Modified
```
src/core/MathUtils.hpp          - Mathematical utilities and SIMD operations
src/core/MathUtils.cpp          - Implementation (excluding template parts)
src/core/PricingEngine.hpp      - Comprehensive pricing engine
src/core/PricingEngine.cpp      - Multi-instrument pricing implementation  
src/phase3_demo.cpp             - Complete demonstration application
src/core/CMakeLists.txt         - Updated build configuration
CMakeLists.txt                  - Updated for Phase 3 components
```

Phase 3 is now complete and ready for integration with the UI/UX system. The pricing engine provides a solid foundation for the mispricing detection engine in Phase 4.
