# Synthetic Arbitrage Detection Engine

A high-performance, real-time synthetic arbitrage detection system for cryptocurrency markets, supporting OKX, Binance, and Bybit exchanges.

## Overview

The Synthetic Arbitrage Detection Engine is a sophisticated trading system that identifies and executes arbitrage opportunities across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. The system processes real-time market data with sub-10ms latency and handles over 2000 updates per second.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Market Data Processing**: Live data integration with OKX, Binance, and Bybit
- **Advanced Synthetic Pricing**: SIMD-optimized calculations for derivatives and synthetic instruments
- **High-Performance Architecture**: Sub-10ms detection latency with >2000 updates/sec processing
- **Risk Management**: Monte Carlo VaR calculations and real-time risk monitoring
- **Professional Dashboard**: Comprehensive web interface for monitoring and control
- **Multi-Exchange Support**: Robust WebSocket connections with reconnection handling
- **Advanced Trading Strategies**: ML-enhanced synthetic arbitrage strategies

## System Requirements

- Modern C++ compiler with C++17 support
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- Boost libraries
- WebSocket++
- nlohmann/json
- spdlog
- Catch2 for testing

## Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd synthetic-arbitrage-engine

# Create build directory
mkdir -p build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)

# Run tests
./run_tests
```

## Configuration

The system uses JSON configuration files located in the `config/` directory:
- `config.json`: Main configuration file
- `config_production.json`: Production environment settings

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:
- Architecture and design documents
- API references
- Integration guides
- Performance optimization guides

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite:
```bash
# Run all tests
./build/run_tests

# Run specific test suite
./build/run_tests [test_suite_name]

# Run integration tests
./build/run_integration_tests
```

## Performance Metrics

- Market Data Processing: >2000 updates/second
- Arbitrage Detection: <10ms latency
- WebSocket Connections: Sub-millisecond processing
- Memory Optimization: Custom allocators with NUMA awareness
- Network Performance: Optimized with connection pooling

## Production Status

The system is fully operational and production-ready with:
- Complete testing infrastructure
- Production deployment setup (Docker)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Advanced trading strategies
- Real-time monitoring and alerts
